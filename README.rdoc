=SemesterTranslator

This is a simple library that allows you to easily translate different (often legacy) semester naming 
conventions used at Cornell University.  The inputs can be either a hash of individual, named items, or a 
string in the format of {semester name}-{year}.

The class allows you to see the semester and year represented in the following ways:

* semester: The standard name of a semester, Spring, Summer, or Fall
* semester_code: Cornell's legacy numeric code values, 20, 65, 70, etc.
* year: The four-digit year
* term: The compound term, used in PeopleSoft, S09, U09, F09, etc.

The input when initializing can take any number of the above as keys in a hash.

=Example

You can pass information to the class in a variety of ways:

	st = Cornell::SemesterTranslator.new(:term => 'U09')
	st.semester
		# => "Summer"
	st.year
		# => 2009
	st.semester_code
		# => 65

  st = Cornell::SemesterTranslator.new(:semester_code => 70, :year => '2009')
	st.semester
		# => "Fall"
	st.term
		# => "F09"

If you just pass a semester code, the term and year will not be available:

	st = Cornell::SemesterTranslator.new(:semester_code => 70)
	st.semester
		# => "Fall"
	st.term
		# => nil

You can also just pass a string:

	st = Cornell::SemesterTranslator.new('Spring 1996')
	st.semester
		# => "Spring"
	st.year
		# => 1996
	st.semester_code
		# => 20  
	st.term
		# => "S96"  

You can see more examples in the test file.

=Installation

To use this as a Rails plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/daphonz/Cornell-Semester-Translator.git
  
You don't need rails for this to work, you can also just copy the two files in the /lib/ directory and require them as needed into your Ruby scripts.
